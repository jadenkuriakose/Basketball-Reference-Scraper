A simple stat scraper to take main stats(points, rebounds, assists) and compile and compare them
Works for most popular players but for certain names that are popular like Jaylen Williams or lesser known names, the comparison and scraping mechanisms may not work
Additionally, depreciation to the Tkinter Library or changes to the HTML layout of basketballreference.com may impede the program from working

This program uses Tkinter for display and uses Python with beautifulSoup4 to scrape data off the basketballrefernce website
